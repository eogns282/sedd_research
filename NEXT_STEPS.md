# Project Handoff & Next Steps

## 1. Project Overview & Current State

This repository contains a robust, verified, and well-documented research framework for experimenting with Score-Entropy Discrete Diffusion (SEDD) models.

- **Core Implementation:** A faithful implementation of the models described in the SEDD paper, including both **Uniform** and **Absorbing** state diffusion processes.
- **Configuration:** All experiments are managed via `.yaml` files (`uniform_config.yaml`, `absorbing_config.yaml`). The main entry points are `run_train.sh` and `run_final_analysis.sh`.
- **Verified Functionality:** The entire pipeline, from training to analysis, has been verified and is known to be in a good, stable state. All previous bugs have been fixed.
- **Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG):** The framework includes a full implementation of CFG, allowing for research into controllable and guided generation.

## 2. Summary of Key Findings

Our initial experiments have produced a clear and definitive result:

**The Absorbing state model is unequivocally superior to the Uniform state model across all key metrics.**

1.  **Quantitative Performance:** The Absorbing model achieves a lower (better) perplexity on the test set, indicating a more accurate language model.
2.  **Generation Quality:** The Absorbing model produces text that is significantly more diverse and coherent.
3.  **Contextual Understanding:** The Absorbing model excels at infilling (filling in masked text), a critical task that the Uniform model fails completely. This demonstrates its superior ability to learn and use context.

These findings strongly suggest that the **Absorbing state model should be the primary focus of future research**.

## 3. Primary Research Goal

The central research goal is to investigate and understand the properties of the "latent space" in discrete diffusion, particularly for the high-performing Absorbing state model. The key questions are:

- **How can we leverage the model's learned reverse trajectory for controllable text generation?**
- **How does Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) affect the quality, diversity, and controllability of the output?**
- **Can we develop new methods for guiding the generation process beyond simple infilling?**

## 4. Detailed Roadmap for the Next Agent

To achieve the research goal, here is a step-by-step plan for the next coding agent.

### Step 1: Explore Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)

The immediate next step is to use the already-implemented CFG functionality to explore its effects.

- **Action:** Modify the `run_final_analysis.sh` script to run the analysis on the `final_absorbing` model with different values for the `--guidance_scale` parameter.
- **Experiment Plan:**
    - Run the analysis for `guidance_scale` values of `1.0` (the default), `1.5`, `2.0`, and `3.0`.
    - For each run, focus on the **infilling** and **diversity** analysis parts.
- **Expected Outcome:** A set of output files in `analysis_results/final_absorbing/` that show how increasing the guidance scale impacts the coherence of the infilled text and the diversity of the generated samples. This will be the first direct insight into controllability.

### Step 2: Implement a Dedicated Generation Script

The `analyze_models.py` script is good for evaluation, but a dedicated `generate.py` script is needed for more flexible, prompt-based generation.

- **Action:** Create a new script, `src/generate.py`.
- **Features:**
    - It should load a trained model from a checkpoint (e.g., `checkpoints/final_absorbing/best_checkpoint.pt`).
    - It should take a command-line argument for a **text prompt**.
    - It should take an argument for `--guidance_scale`.
    - **Logic:** The script will use the prompt to create a starting `x_t` state (e.g., by taking the prompt and padding it with `[MASK]` tokens) and then use the `remove_noise` function to generate a completion, guided by the prompt and the CFG scale.

### Step 3: Investigate Advanced Guidance Techniques

Once basic prompting is established, the next step is to explore more advanced ways to guide the generation.

- **Action:** Extend the `generate.py` script to support more complex guidance strategies.
- **Potential Ideas:**
    - **Part-of-Speech (POS) Guidance:** Can we guide the model to generate a sentence with a specific grammatical structure (e.g., Noun-Verb-Adjective-Noun)? This would involve creating a "guidance model" that penalizes generations that don't match the target POS sequence.
    - **Sentiment Guidance:** Can we guide the model to produce text with a positive or negative sentiment? This could be done by using a pre-trained sentiment classifier to guide the diffusion process.
    - **Length Guidance:** Can we control the length of the generated output more explicitly?

### Step 4: Summarize and Report Findings

- **Action:** After each major step, the agent should summarize its findings in a clear, concise report, similar to the one generated at the end of the initial development phase. This will ensure the research is well-documented and the project's progress is tracked effectively.

This roadmap provides a clear and logical path forward. The codebase is stable and ready for these next steps. Good luck.
