# Project Summary & Next Steps

## 1. Project Goal & Successful Outcome

The primary goal of this research was to diagnose the underperformance of the Uniform discrete diffusion model and engineer a novel `uniform`-based model that could outperform the strong `absorbing` state baseline.

**This goal has been successfully achieved.**

Through a series of targeted experiments, we developed the **Frequency-Aware Hybrid Model**, which combines two key innovations:
1.  **Self-Distrust Anchoring:** A small percentage (10%) of noise tokens are replaced with a `[MASK]` token, providing a stable anchor for the model to learn from.
2.  **Frequency-Aware Noise:** The remaining 90% of noise tokens are sampled from the true frequency distribution of the training data, creating a more plausible and less destructive corruption.

This synergistic model achieved a perplexity of **24.38**, surpassing the `absorbing` baseline's **24.60**.

## 2. Final Model Configuration

The configuration for the state-of-the-art model can be found in `freq_hybrid_config.yaml`, and the experiment can be reproduced by running `./run_freq_hybrid_experiment.sh`.

## 3. Future Work & Open Questions

While we have achieved our primary goal, this research opens up several exciting avenues for future work.

### Flag for Future Work: The Gating Anomaly

A key flag for future investigation is the **unexpected negative interaction between the Gated-Attention mechanism and our best-performing hybrid noise models.** While gating was highly effective on a pure `absorbing` model, it degraded the performance of the `self-distrust_hybrid` model.

**Next Research Question:** Why does the Gated-Attention mechanism fail on hybrid noise models, and can it be adapted to work synergistically with them?

**Hypotheses:**
1.  **Signal Dilution:** The gate might be learning to distrust *all* noise (both uniform and mask), effectively ignoring the helpful anchor signal provided by the `[MASK]` tokens.
2.  **Hyperparameter Mismatch:** The `gate_loss_weight` and other related hyperparameters may need to be re-tuned specifically for the hybrid noise distribution.
3.  **Architectural Interference:** The gating mechanism might be interfering with the model's ability to learn the more complex patterns present in the frequency-aware noise.

**Proposed Next Experiment:**
-   Conduct an ablation study on a **Gated Frequency-Aware Hybrid** model.
-   Train several versions with different `gate_loss_weight` values (e.g., 0.01, 0.05, 0.2) to see if a weaker or stronger gate signal can restore the performance gains.
-   Analyze the learned gate scores to understand what the model is learning to trust and distrust in the hybrid noise setting.

This represents a clear and promising direction for building upon the successful foundation established in this project.
